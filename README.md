# Driver-Drowsiness

Overview
This project detects driver drowsiness in real-time using computer vision techniques. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for eye state classification and OpenCV for face and eye detection. An alert mechanism using sound signals via Pygame ensures timely driver attention upon detecting signs of drowsiness.

Functionality
Real-time Monitoring: Utilizes webcam feeds to track the driver's face and monitor eye closures.
Eye State Classification: CNN model predicts eye states (open/closed) to detect drowsiness.
Alert System: Triggers audio alerts when drowsiness is detected, promoting driver alertness and safety.
Usage
Ensure Python 3.x and necessary libraries (OpenCV, Keras with TensorFlow, Pygame) are installed. Run the system to monitor driver drowsiness during operation.
